# a function that takes a list and prints if the value 5 is in that list.

def list_print():  # creates function
    # creates the list by assigning var to each input
    a = int(input("First?: "))
    b = int(input("Second number?: "))
    c = int(input("Third number?: "))
    d = int(input("Fourth number?: "))
    my_list = [a, b, c, d]  # creates the list of vars
    # if statements for the lists
    if a == 5:
        print(my_list)
    elif b == 5:
        print(my_list)
    elif c == 5:
        print(my_list)
    elif d == 5:
        print(my_list)
    else:
        print("this list does not have the number 5 so it will not be printed")

# could not figure out how to complete this problem using the blank list []
# if possible any feedback on how to would be greatly appreciated
